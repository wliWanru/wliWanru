### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wanru! 

* I'm a fifth-year PhD student in **BLAB (lab head: Dr. Pinglei Bao)** at Peking University. Our lab focus on high-level vision cognition in human and non-human primate! 
* I earned my bachlor's degree in Psychology in East China Normal University. I was a member of **[MElab (Memory and Emotion Lab; lab head: Dr. Yixuan Ku)](https://sysumelab.com/)** investigating the influence of acute stress on visual working memory back then. 
* I'm working on the neural mechanism of scene perception and visual working memory of high-level visual stimuli. 
* I use fMRI and M/EEG to study human vision. I also had experience with tDCS and physiological signal recording in my stress project.
* I'm a co-author of [the first Chinese Python EEG data analysis handbook](https://github.com/ZitongLu1996/Python-EEG-Handbook) and [An easy-to-follow handbook for electroencephalogram data analysis with Python](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/brx2.64)
* ðŸ“« wanruli@stu.pku.edu.cn and I'm looking forward to discussing anything about cognitive neuroscience, Python/MATLAB/R coding, any kinds of neuroscience techniques and all of my projects!
