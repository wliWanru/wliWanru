### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wanru! 

* I'm a second-year PhD student in **BLAB (lab head: Dr. Pinglei Bao)** at Peking University. Our lab focus on high-level vision cognition in human and non-human primate! 
* I earned my bachlor degree in Psychology in East China Normal University. I was a member of **MElab (Memory and Emotion Lab; lab head: Dr. Yixuan Ku)** investigating the influence of acute stress on visual working memory. 
* I'm working on the neural mechanism of visual working memory of high-level visual stimuli. 
* I use M/EEG and fMRI to study human vision. I also had experience with tDCS and physiological signal recording in my stress project.
